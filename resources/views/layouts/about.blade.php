              <h3>History</h3>
              <p class="about-paddingB">In 1933, the Philippines is under the Commonwealth government headed by Pres. Manuel Luis Quezon 
              is a country to be developed. Since the country’s main livelihood is agriculture, the government has focused mainly on 
              agricultural programs such as the upliftment of animal production in the country. With these program then, the 
              Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources has promoted a program of establishing a breeding station to each provinces 
              to serve the community in upgrading local breeds of animals so as to have higher output on the carcass. So as the program was implemented, 
              Tarlac has been fortunately lucky enough to be one of the pioneer in receiving the graces of the program. So in 1983 the Tarlac Breeding Station 
              was established leasing to the DANR from a portion of the area of Camp Aquino now called Camp Servillano Aquino located at San Miguel, 
              Tarlac. Tarlac as its own location, as its initial stocks the government has imported breeding animals such as swine, goats, cattle, and 
              horses readily for use to those who want to avail in upgrading the breed of backyard animal raisers. In 1964 the leased area to the BAI 
              by the AFP has been released from the AFP’s given solely for use of the DANR (BAI) which is covered under the Proclamation Order No. 255 
              dated June 3, 1964 which was signed by then, President Diosdado Macapagal. <br /><br />
              
              As years passed by, the station has served the whole province inspite of problem undermaned. As understaffed compared with the volume of work it 
              is handling, problem has properly endorsed to authorities and was also solved by deciding to established additional breeding centers to the different 
              towns in the province. The DANR thru the representation of men to local officials in the municipalities and civic spirited people at Camiling has 
              agreed to have a breeding center thereat, and so in 1956 the Camiling Breeding Center was opened
